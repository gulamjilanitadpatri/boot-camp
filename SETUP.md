# Python Boot Camp — Setup

## 1. Create Google Sheet
Create one Google Spreadsheet and add these tabs:
Registration, Admin, AptitudeTests, AptitudeQuestions, TestResults, Attendance.

Use the exact columns listed in SHEET_STRUCTURE.txt.

## 2. Add Apps Script
Open the spreadsheet:
Extensions → Apps Script

Delete the existing code and paste all code from Code.gs.

Save.

## 3. Deploy API
Deploy → New deployment → Web app
- Execute as: Me
- Who has access: Anyone

Deploy and copy the Web App URL ending in /exec.

## 4. Connect website
Open config.js and replace:
PASTE_YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_EXEC_URL_HERE

with your /exec URL.

## 5. Add an admin
In the Admin sheet put your admin email and password in row 2.

## 6. Run quickly
For a simple local test, open the folder in VS Code and use Live Server.
Do not double-click HTML if your browser blocks local requests.

## 7. Admin workflow
Admin Login → Create Test → Add Questions → Students can see the test → Students submit → automatic result → result appears in dashboard and TestResults.

## 8. Important
This is a learning/project implementation. Passwords are stored in the sheet as plain text in this simple version. For production use, use proper password hashing and stronger authentication.
